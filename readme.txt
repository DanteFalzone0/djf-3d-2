# djf-3d-2

A while ago I wrote a very bad 3d-engine in very,
very bad C++ (https://github.com/DanteFalzone0/djf-3d).
This is an attempt to write a much better 3d engine in C++
using modern C++ features and proper programming practices.

The demo program for this can load 3d models in the
Wavefront obj file format, but they don't look pretty and
they often don't look correct because the line-drawing
algorithm is pretty naive.

C++ may have started out as an extension of C, but I have
to say that writing in modern C++ doesn't feel anything like
writing in C. It feels much more like an unholy chimera of
C, Java, and Rust that is no more like one of them than the
others, and that happens to be able to do interop with C very,
very smoothly.
