This is the directory where the object files will
go. This way they can be kept separate from the
source files. This is NOT a directory for putting
3d models in the Wavefront OBJ file format (although
there's nothing stopping you from using it as such),
it is for compiled *.o files to be linked to
demo/main.cpp (or any other program that uses the
engine).
