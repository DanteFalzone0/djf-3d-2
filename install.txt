Installing djf-3d-2 on GNU/Linux is very easy. Your mileage
may vary on other *nix systems.

There's no need to clone the repo if you just want to install
the library. All you have to do is this:
    0. wget https://github.com/DanteFalzone0/djf-3d-2/raw/master/djf-3d-2.tar.gz
    1. Open up the tarball (tar -xzvf djf-3d-2.tar.gz)
    2. cd djf-3d-2
    3. make
    4. sudo make install

That's it! Now you can write programs that use djf-3d-2 by
putting "#include <djf-3d-2/djf-3d.h>" in them. Remember to
link them to the engine by passing "-ldjf-3d-2 -lSDL2" to
GCC when compiling; they MUST be in that order.

The header files are filled with documentation comments, so
be sure to read /usr/include/djf-3d-2/*.h for guidance on
writing programs that use djf-3d-2. Later I will write
better documentation.

djf-3d-2 is written in C++. It is NOT written to integrate
with C. Your C++ compiler MUST support C++11 or later for
any of this to work.

To uninstall djf-3d-2, run "sudo make uninstall".

To see an example program that uses djf-3d-2, make sure that
the library is installed, then run "make run-demo".
